Welcome to gplearn extension : MultiView Symbolic Regression (MvSR)!
===================

This extension is based on the GPlearn code available here : https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn

In this extension we propose a way to find parametric a single equation capable of describing multiple data sets at the same. The interface is similar to the original GPlearn, expect that the user can now feed tuples of objects instead of just one. Addition option are available as well. In this current version only the SymbolicRegressor is working. A basic example of how to use the tools is provided in the "MvSR_example" notebook.
